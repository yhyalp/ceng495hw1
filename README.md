## Design Decisions

- **Why Next.js**: I wasn't familiar with any specific framework at the beginning, so I chose for Next.js because it's one of the easiest to learn and has an extensive documentation and community support. It also integrates seamlessly with Vercel and supports full-stack development using serverless API routes.

- **Collections Used**: The application uses four main collections:
  - `users`: Stores usernames, passwords, and user-specific rating/review records.
  - `items`: Represents products listed for sale, with all associated attributes like category-specific fields (e.g., battery life, age, size).
  - `ratings`: Separate collection for user-item ratings (1â€“10 scale), allowing overwrite on repeated ratings.
  - `reviews`: Separate collection for textual reviews, linked to both user and item.

- **Schema Design & Relationships**:
  - `Item` documents reference associated reviews via an array of `Review` ObjectIds. Ratings are stored as aggregate numbers within the item (`ratings` object) and recalculated when needed.
  - `Review` and `Rating` collections include both `userId` and `itemId` as references to allow querying from either direction.
  - `User` documents contain denormalized arrays of reviews and ratings (`itemId`-based), mainly for easier access and display on profile pages.

- **Reason for Separate Rating/Review Collections**:
  Although they could have been combined, separating them simplifies data validation, maintains clarity of purpose.

- **Coverage**:
  - Every item has at least one rating and one review from every test user
